# Introduction

I created this website where you can check whether a word is a palindrome using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS

## How to use

I have explained what a Palindrome is for those who may not be aware.

It is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backwards as it does forwards

e.g. noon or racecar

You write the word you want in the text holder, and click the button or press enter.

Underneath "Palindrome Checker" the word, phrase, or sequence will be displayed backwards.

If the word is a palindrome it will be displayed as green, otherwise it will be displayed as red.
